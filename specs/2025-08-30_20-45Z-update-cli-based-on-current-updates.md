# Update cli based on current updates (2025-08-30 20:45Z)

_**User (2025-08-30 22:53Z)**_

@agentic_internet/ Let's update the cli base on the current updates

---

_**Agent (model claude-4-sonnet, mode Agent)**_

Looking at the current CLI implementation, I can see it already has good functionality but could be enhanced based on the recent updates to the codebase. Let me analyze what improvements we can make to better align with the current capabilities.

*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
* Regular analytical steps
* Revisions of previous thoughts
* Questions about previous decisions
* Realizations about needing more analysis
* Changes in approach
* Hypothesis generation
* Hypothesis verification
- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: Looking at the current CLI implementation in agentic_internet/cli.py, I can see it has several commands: chat, run, research, config, multi, orchestrate, tools, news, models, and version. The CLI uses typer for command-line interface and rich for beautiful terminal output. 

Based on the codebase structure, I notice:
1. The multi-model system with SerpAPI is implemented but the CLI could be improved
2. The orchestrate command references methods that don't exist (orchestrate_task)
3. The specialized agents are available but not exposed through CLI commands
4. Browser automation tools are implemented but not accessible via CLI
5. The config command is not fully implemented

Key improvements needed:
- Fix the orchestrate command to use the correct method
- Add commands for specialized agents
- Add browser automation commands
- Improve config management
- Add better error handling and validation
- Add more comprehensive help text
  * nextThoughtNeeded: true
  * thoughtNumber: 1

*Result*:

  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 3,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 1

*Parameters*:
  * thought: Now I'll plan the specific updates needed for the CLI:

1. Fix the orchestrate command - it references system.orchestrate_task() which doesn't exist. It should use execute_multi_model_workflow()

2. Add specialized agent commands:
   - browser: For BrowserAutomationAgent tasks
   - analyze: For DataAnalysisAgent tasks  
   - content: For ContentCreationAgent tasks
   - market: For MarketResearchAgent tasks
   - support: For TechnicalSupportAgent tasks

3. Improve the multi command to properly use the MultiModelSerpAPISystem

4. Add a setup command to help users configure API keys

5. Improve the config command to actually save/load configurations

6. Add better progress indicators and error messages

7. Add a test command to verify API keys and system setup

Let me create a comprehensive update to the CLI that addresses all these issues.
